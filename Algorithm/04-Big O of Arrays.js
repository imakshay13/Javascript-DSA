//An Array is a collection of different or same type of values
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
/*
1.Insert/Remove from end of an array -> Time complexity is O(1) constant
2. Insert/Remove from start of an array -> Time Complexity -> O(n) Linear 
3. Access an element -> O(1) constant
4. Searching an element -> O(n) Linear

Common Array methods:
1. push/pop -> O(1) constant
2. shift/unshift/concat/slice/splice -> O(n) Linear
3. forEach/map/filter/reduce -> O(n)

In case forEach,map,filter,reduce callback function has another for loop then the complexity is quadric
O(n square)
